BCNF: A relation is in BCNF if and only if every nontrivial, left irreducible FD has a super key ( for simplicity we consider candidate key) as its determinant.
1. Partial and Transitive Dependencies 
Objective: Identifying and listing all functional dependencies, including partial and transitive dependencies.
Tables and Functional Dependencies (FDs):
Users Table
Attributes: USERID, USERNAME, PASSWORD, EMAIL, ROLE
Primary Key: USERID
Functional Dependency: USERID → USERNAME, PASSWORD, EMAIL, ROLE
Analysis: Since USERID determines all other attributes directly, there are no transitive dependencies. This table is already in 3NF and BCNF.
Auction Table
Attributes: AUCTIONID, CARID, STARTTIME, ENDTIME, RESERVEPRICE, CURRENTBID, DETAILS, STATUS, STARTINGBID
Primary Key: AUCTIONID
Functional Dependency: AUCTIONID → CARID, STARTTIME, ENDTIME, RESERVEPRICE, CURRENTBID, DETAILS, STATUS, STARTINGBID
Analysis: AUCTIONID is the primary key and determines all other attributes, so this table has no transitive dependencies and is in 3NF and BCNF.
Bids Table
Attributes: BIDID, AUCTIONID, USERID, BIDAMOUNT, BIDTIME
Primary Key: BIDID
Functional Dependencies:
BIDID → AUCTIONID, USERID, BIDAMOUNT, BIDTIME
AUCTIONID, USERID, BIDTIME → BIDAMOUNT
Analysis: BIDID uniquely identifies each bid, and all other attributes depend directly on it. The composite key dependency (AUCTIONID, USERID, BIDTIME → BIDAMOUNT) also does not violate BCNF. Therefore, the Bids table is in BCNF.
Cars Table
Attributes: CARID, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, MILEAGE, VIN, DESCRIPTION, USERID, IMAGEURL
Primary Key: CARID
Functional Dependency: CARID → MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, MILEAGE, VIN, DESCRIPTION, USERID, IMAGEURL
Analysis: All attributes depend directly on CARID, the primary key. There are no partial or transitive dependencies, so the Cars table is in BCNF.
Transactions Table
Attributes: TRANSACTIONID, USERID, AUCTIONID, PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE
Primary Key: TRANSACTIONID
Functional Dependencies:
TRANSACTIONID → USERID, AUCTIONID, PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE
USERID, AUCTIONID → PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE (if one payment per auction per user)
Analysis: Since there is a transitive dependency between USERID, AUCTIONID and PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE, we decompose this table to remove the transitive dependency using Bernstein’s Algorithm (explained below).

2. Bernstein and BCNF Algorithms
Applying Bernstein's Algorithm to Transactions Table:
Step 1: Identify Functional Dependencies:
TRANSACTIONID → USERID, AUCTIONID, PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE
USERID, AUCTIONID → PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE
Step 2: Decompose into relations to remove transitive dependencies:
Create Transactions table: R1(TRANSACTIONID, USERID, AUCTIONID) with TRANSACTIONID as the primary key.
Create UserPayments table: R2(USERID, AUCTIONID, PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE) with the composite key (USERID, AUCTIONID) as the primary key.
Result: This decomposition removes the transitive dependency by ensuring that each determinant in UserPayments and Transactions is a candidate key, fulfilling BCNF requirements.

3. Conclusion:
Each table now adheres to BCNF standards. The Transactions table was successfully decomposed into Transactions and UserPayments using Bernstein’s Algorithm to remove transitive dependencies, ensuring compliance with BCNF.

Summary and Final Tables in BCNF
Each table is now in BCNF after verifying and decomposing based on functional dependencies. The final tables are:
Users Table: USERID, USERNAME, PASSWORD, EMAIL, ROLE
Auction Table: AUCTIONID, CARID, STARTTIME, ENDTIME, RESERVEPRICE, CURRENTBID, DETAILS, STATUS, STARTINGBID
Bids Table: BIDID, AUCTIONID, USERID, BIDAMOUNT, BIDTIME
Cars Table: CARID, MAKE, MODEL, YEAR, MILEAGE, VIN, DESCRIPTION, USERID, IMAGEURL
Transactions Table (Decomposed):
Transactions: TRANSACTIONID, USERID, AUCTIONID
UserPayments: USERID, AUCTIONID, PAYMENTAMOUNT, PAYMENTDATE
