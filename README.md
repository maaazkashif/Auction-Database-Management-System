# Auction-Database-Management-System
1. Project Description
The Car Auction Management System is designed to streamline car auctions by managing users, auctions, bids, and car details. This project demonstrates the integration of a normalized database (in BCNF) with a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI). The system provides functionalities for managing records, conducting searches, and ensuring data consistency through relational database design principles.

2. Database Design
  2.1  Schema Design
The database consists of the following tables:
Users Table
Attributes: UserID, Username, Password, Email, Role (Buyer/Seller)
Role ensures users are classified correctly.

Cars Table
Attributes: CarID, Make, Model, Year, Color, Mileage
Ensures unique identification of cars with essential details.

Auction Table
Attributes: AuctionID, CarID, StartTime, EndTime, ReservePrice, CurrentBid, Details, Status, StartingBid
Tracks auctions and links to the Cars table.

Bids Table
Attributes: BidID, AuctionID, UserID, BidAmount, BidTime
Links users with auctions and maintains bidding history.

(Transactions Table Decomposed into two tables resulting in BCNF form)
Transaction Table
Attributes: TransactionID, UserID, AuctionID
Links the TransactionID to UserID and AuctionID

UserPayment Table
Attributes: AuctionID, UserID, PaymentAmount, PaymentDate
Links AuctionID and UserID to PaymentAmount and PaymentDate

2.2 Normalization
All tables in the database are normalized to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) by satisfying the following requirements:
Each table has a primary key:
Every table is uniquely identified by a single primary key or a composite primary key, ensuring no duplicate records exist. 
All attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key:
For tables with composite keys, each attribute is fully dependent on the entire primary key, eliminating any partial dependencies.
No transitive dependencies exist:
Non-prime attributes (attributes that are not part of any candidate key) depend only on the primary key. No attribute depends on another non-prime attribute, ensuring the elimination of transitive dependencies.
Each functional dependency satisfies BCNF criteria:
For every functional dependency Xâ†’YX \rightarrow Y, XX is either a superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row) or the dependency does not exist.
No multivalued dependencies:
All attributes are scalar values, ensuring no attribute contains sets, lists, or repeating groups.

Ensuring minimal redundancy:
By achieving BCNF, the schema design reduces duplication and redundancy, optimizing storage and maintaining data integrity.
This strict adherence to BCNF ensures the database schema is robust, consistent, and free from anomalies during updates, deletions, or insertions.


3. Application Functionality
4.1 GUI Features

My application provides the following features, implemented using Python Tkinter for the graphical user interface:
View Tables:
- Display data from Users, Cars, Auction, and Bids tables in a tabular format within the application.
- The tables are dynamically updated to reflect the latest database state.

Search Functionality:
- Search for cars by their make or model using an input field and a search button.
- Results are displayed in a new table showing all matching records.

Add Records:
- Users can add new records to the Users, Cars, or Auction tables.
- Field-by-field entry forms are provided for each table, along with a submission button.

Drop Tables:
- One-click functionality to drop all tables from the database.
- A confirmation dialog ensures accidental deletions are avoided.

Error Handling:
- Alerts are displayed for invalid inputs or unsuccessful operations.
- Examples include error messages for duplicate primary keys, missing fields, or unsupported data types.

4. Feedback Integration
Feedback from Phase I and II
Improved GUI design to be more user-friendly.
Enhanced database normalization to 3NF.
Added error handling and feedback messages.
Implemented Changes
Included a Cars table with additional attributes like mileage.
Added a search feature for cars.
Provided a drop-all-tables functionality.

5. Concluding Remarks
The Car Auction Management System demonstrates a robust integration of database design and application development principles. The database adheres to 3NF, ensuring no redundancy or anomalies. The GUI provides intuitive operations for managing and querying data.
Key Takeaways:
Database normalization significantly improves data integrity.
Error handling and feedback are crucial for user-friendly applications.
Modular design simplifies the addition of new features.
This project has enhanced our understanding of database management systems, GUI development, and real-world problem-solving in software engineering.
